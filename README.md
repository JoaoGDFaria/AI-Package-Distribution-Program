# Artificial Intelligence Project

In this project we were asked to make a graph representing a real city with connections between each node such as in real life. We decided to use Famalicão, Barcelos and Braga as the basis, having different "pick-up" points along the graph in order to make it more complex. We implemented 2 menus, one more educative abouth the searchs and one with the program itself.

We needed to create a distribution company that favors more ecological travel, using bicycles, but also having motorcycles and cars available. Each of these vehicles would have a maximum capacity that would directly affect its speed.

We were asked to implement algorithms such as BFS, DFS, A*, Greedy, Uniform Cost and Iterative in order to compare results and to better understand how these algorithms work.
